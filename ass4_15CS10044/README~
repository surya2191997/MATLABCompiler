Limitations : 
->Function should be declared before defining.
->Arrays not supported, only matrices are supported








EXPLANATION OF GRAMMAR AUGMENTATIONS : 


->The translator only support matrices. Arrays are not supported. Following rules are augmented :

postfix-expression --> primary-expression[expression][expression]
direct-declarator  --> IDENTIFIER [assignment-expression][assignment-expression]

->To make backpatching possible by putting the index of quad where required, non terminal M has been augmented, with reduction to epsilon. 

->For implementation of unconditional goto when reduced to epsilon, non terminal N has been augmented.

->Non terminal F is augmented, for function declaration computation handling.
